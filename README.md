#Unity Gain Amplifier
The design of a unity gain amplifier on Cadence involves creating a circuit with a gain of one to buffer signals without amplification or attenuation. This is typically achieved using an operational amplifier (op-amp) configured in a voltage follower topology, where the output is connected directly to the inverting input.  

Using Cadence Virtuoso, the schematic is constructed by placing and connecting the op-amp, power supply, and input/output terminals. Key design considerations include selecting an op-amp with high input impedance and low output impedance to ensure signal integrity. Post-design, simulations are run to verify performance metrics such as gain stability, bandwidth, and linearity, ensuring the amplifier meets desired specifications.
